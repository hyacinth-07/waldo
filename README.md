# waldo

- client contains the front end (Vite, react, tailwind)
- server the backend (node js, express, mongodb)

- after the game is fully functional, refactor everything into its own component
- aka share state properly, read docs

- create stageSelect UI, where the user can pick three stages to play

- setTimeouts in UI suck. do something else
- make it pretty, with animations and text that pops up creatively
